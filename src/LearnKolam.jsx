      {/* Introduction */}
      <section className="lesson">
        <h2>Introduction to Kolam</h2>
        <p>
          Kolams are traditional South Indian art forms made by drawing continuous lines around
          a set of dots (Pullis). They are drawn daily as a cultural practice and are also a
          powerful way to explore geometry, symmetry, and algorithmic thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pulli Kolam follows 3 essential rules:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>All lines must form closed loops.</li>
          <li>All dots must be encircled.</li>
          <li>Lines cannot overlap over a finite length.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      {/* Cultural Context */}
      <section className="lesson">
        <h2>Culture and Process</h2>
        <p>
          Traditionally, women draw Kolams every morning using rice flour on freshly cleaned floors.
          Kolams are seen as offerings to the earth goddess Bhudevi and often symbolize prosperity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Artists may use multiple colors to indicate different loops and layers, making complex patterns
          easier to understand.

      {/* Methodology */}
      <section className="lesson">
        <h2>Methodology & Rules</h2>
        <p>
          Two main coding approaches for Kolams:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Looping Kolams:</strong> Place dots in a grid and use continuous lines (loops)
            to connect them. Curves are drawn smoothly without right angles.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Kolam Cartesian / Shapes:</strong> Represent tiles with curved sides as 0 or 1.
            Place tiles in a diagonal grid to maintain symmetry and single-line drawing rules.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>Rules for Pulli Kolam:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Lines never retrace the same route.</li>
          <li>All points are enclosed by lines.</li>
          <li>Lines drawn diagonally at 45Â° angles.</li>
          <li>Lines are smooth, with arcs surrounding the points.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      {/* Mathematical & Coding Insights */}
      <section className="lesson">
        <h2>Mathematical Insights</h2>
        <p>
          Kolams illustrate fractals, symmetry, and space-filling curves. They can also be
          translated into arrays or coded algorithms, preserving traditional rules in digital form.
        </p>
        <p>
          Coding Kolams allows exploration of geometry, iterative patterns, and visual mathematics,
          bridging culture and computational thinking.
